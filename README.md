Rule file format reference: https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules#rulemd-file-format

**When to use**

- You’re frustrated by misleading internal comments or docs.
- Your team can tolerate fewer comments as the price of removing lies.
- You will accept commits and PRs that simply delete lies without replacing them with truths.

**What it enforces**

- Internal prose is either true right now or gone.
- Finding a lie does not create a duty to explain more; deletion is fine.
- This rule says nothing about how much to comment — only that any prose that exists must be true.

**Credits**

- Developed by Will Wieselquist. Anyone can use it.
